# Markov_for_PDE

This is a short project showing how to use Markov Chains to solve some PDEs numerically.

The PDF file contains all the explanations on the method and shows some results.

The notebook is the implementation of the ideas exposed in the paper, and was used to produce the simulations discussed in it.
